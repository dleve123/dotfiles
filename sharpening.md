# Development Setup TODOs
- [ ] remap vim exit-from-INSERT mode to 'jj' or the command that everyone else uses...
- [ ] send hostname color in command line prompt to something different than green when not on thunder (laptop)
- [x] make vim addons submodules to make config bootstrapping process easier
- [x] definitely fix dotfiles repo so that vim backup files are removed or the proper directories are created!
- [ ] FIX autocompletion of variable names in rails console (/ irb?) when in vi-mode!!!
